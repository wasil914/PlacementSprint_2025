# PlacementSprint_2025
Placement_Sprint_2025 is a comprehensive repository documenting my 6-month journey towards placement preparation.
This repository will include:

Daily DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice in Java

Core Computer Science subjects notes and resources (such as Operating Systems, DBMS, OOPs, Computer Networking, etc.)

Occasional projects and mini-projects to strengthen practical skills

The goal is to maintain consistency, deepen understanding of fundamental concepts, and build a strong portfolio for placements in 2025.
